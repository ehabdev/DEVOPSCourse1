Project extension:

Python code changes:
docker_backend_testing.py : It will use the same methods for the REST_APP ,I choosed the get method and it will run under the IP 0.0.0.0 ,
like app.run(host="0.0.0.0") will make the page accessible
by going to http://[ip]:5000/ on any computer in  the network.
 
Jenkins pipeline steps:
1. Pull code from your Github repository holding your project, No changes 

2. Run rest_app.py (backend), No changes

3. Run backend_testing.py, No changes

4. Run clean_environemnt.py, No changes

5. Build Docker image – locally

6. Push Docker image – to HUB
5,6 was implemented by installing the Docker pipeline plug in and followed the same syntax to make it works .

7. Set compose image version – setting the version inside the .env file for docker-compose, Jenkins file 

8. Run docker-compose up -d , Jenkins file,docker-compose.yml

9. Test dockerized app – using docker_backend_testing.py
In addition to docker_backend_testing.py ,I created new python docker_backend_validation.py, it first will git my network local IP and concatenate 
it to create a valid access to rest_app ,and issue another URL access to local host with the same userid -and after the reply I am comparing
the page source to validate that I get the same reply . 

10. Clean environment – will call docker-compose down and delete local image ,Jenkins file
